## GadgetsHub – Styling Guidelines (Sprint 1)

This document explains the styling approach used in the GadgetsHub project.  
The goal of this guide is to ensure consistency, readability, and maintainability of styles across the application.

This document is created as part of Sprint 1 and focuses only on basic global styling and structure.

## 1. Styling Approach
GadgetsHub uses plain CSS with a simple and organized structure.

For Sprint 1, the focus is on:
- Global styles
- CSS variables
- Basic layout consistency

Advanced styling and feature-specific styles will be added in later sprints.
