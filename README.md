## Project General Description

GadgetsHub is designed as an interactive platform where users can browse gadgets, view detailed specifications, and manage personalized data through user accounts.  
The project focuses on demonstrating full-stack concepts including component-based UI design, user interaction, and data management.

### High-Level User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to browse gadgets by category, so that I can easily find products I am interested in.
- As a logged-in user, I want to save gadgets to a personal wishlist, so that I can keep track of products I may want to compare or purchase later.
- As a logged-in user, I want to compare multiple gadgets side-by-side, so that I can make better decisions based on specifications and features.

These user stories guide the overall scope and functionality of the application and may evolve as the project develops.


## Project Scope & Focus

The project is intentionally broad enough to support multiple pages and interactions, while remaining focused on a single domain: consumer electronics.  
Rather than implementing a full e-commerce system, GadgetsHub emphasizes:

- Product discovery
- User-specific data management
- Interactive UI components
- Scalable application structure


## Technology Overview

This project is initialized using Vite with React and TypeScript, following modern best practices for front-end development.  
Additional technologies will be integrated as the project progresses.


## Notes

- The project theme and objectives may be refined over time with group consensus.
- The README will be updated if user stories or scope change.
- The project is evaluated based on technical implementation, not originality of the idea.
